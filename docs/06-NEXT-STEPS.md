# Next Steps

## 🚀 What we need from WiseQ

Everything here is **bounded, low-risk, and mostly already in your hands.** None of it requires a production change.

| # | What we need | Why | Effort on your side | Blocks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **The ~30-page company manual** | Lets us map every tool to its MCP/API availability precisely — no guessing | Send a file | Stack map |
| 2 | **Software inventory** | Which bookkeeping package (Exact? nl.? other?), ChannelDock plan + API access, 5X export access, mailbox provider | A list | Connectors |
| 3 | **Sandbox / dummy data** | A copy of a few anonymized school orders + the offer→invoice flow, so the shadow demo mirrors reality | 30 min to export | Shadow demo |
| 4 | **Read-only API access** *(when ready)* | Shopify (read-only collaborator) · ChannelDock (API token) · bol Seller (sandbox) · mailbox (app-password, read-only first) | Issue 4 tokens | Live read-only |
| 5 | **30 minutes with the purchase manager** | Walkthrough of the EAN/Excel workflow — so we design the replacement against reality, not assumptions | One meeting | Purchase intelligence |

> 🔁 **Items 1–3 need no production access at all.** We can start the stack map and the EAN registry the same day the manual arrives.

## ✅ What we commit to *(Phase 0, ~2 weeks)*

| Deliverable | What it proves | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `data/stack-map.md` | Every tool from your manual, mapped to connector availability | ⬜ Not started |
| **EAN registry v1** | The canonical EAN ↔ SKU ↔ component spine, seeded from ChannelDock + Shopify exports — **no live access needed to start** | ⬜ Not started |
| **Shadow school-order demo** | The pipeline running on dummy data — the "visually, ah, nice" moment promised in the meeting | ⬜ Not started |
| **Read-only dashboard prototype** | Orders, stock, reviews, channel drift — visible without touching production | ⬜ Not started |

## 🧭 Decision points for Rob

Four open decisions. Each has a recommended default — if we don't hear otherwise, we proceed with the recommendation and tell you what we're doing.

| # | Question | Options | Our recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Where does the agent run?** | (a) existing 24/7 office machine · (b) €20/mo VPS · (c) both | **(c)** — VPS as primary, office machine as worker. Survives a power cut at the office. |
| 2 | **Bookkeeping connection style?** | (a) native API if Exact/nl. supports it · (b) browser-automation MCP | **(a) first, (b) as fallback.** API is cleaner; automation is the safety net for vendors without an API. |
| 3 | **Review platform priority?** | Trustpilot (international) · Kiyoh (NL standard) · both | **Both.** Trustpilot for international traffic, Kiyoh for the NL school/B2B segment. |
| 4 | **First revenue engine?** | Review invitations (fastest) · B2B outreach (biggest data advantage) | **Reviews first** — fastest measurable win, and it compounds into every later phase. |
